# ERP
- Lets you configure a partner whose emotes you will copy instantly. This lets you sync dances easily.
- Lets you force use emotes like '14', a special money beg emote

## Usage

### 1 - Match emotes with a partner of your choosing
- `erp partner <name>`  |  Example: `erp partner zari`
  - This will cause an inspect command and will set the partner until you choose another one, or do `erp partner` to clear it.

### 2 - Force emote on demand
- `erp emote <id>`  |  Example: `erp emote 14`

## Extra info
Some emotes in the 40s seem to be some sort of mounted animation, probably used somewhere in the story quests.
